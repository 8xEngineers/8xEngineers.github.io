# Littlefoot Overview

## Introduction
**Littlefoot** is a lightweight JavaScript library designed to simplify the process of creating clickable buttons that automatically configure popovers to be fully visible across different browsers and devices.

## Design Decisions
- **Decision over Option Principle**: Littlefoot adheres to this principle by providing users with fewer options and requiring fewer steps to reach their destination, enhancing the overall user experience.
- **TypeScript**: The library is written in TypeScript, which enables a cleaner architecture and reduces the bundle size.
- **Responsive Design**: The footnote popover is automatically fixed to the bottom for smaller screens, such as mobile devices, ensuring optimal visibility.
- **Customization**: Users can customize the appearance of Littlefoot by overriding CSS custom properties.
- **No jQuery Dependency**: Unlike Bigfoot, Littlefoot does not require jQuery, making it a more lightweight solution.

## Pattern
Littlefoot's design pattern is centered around providing a simple and efficient way to create clickable buttons with automatic popover configuration.

## Language Usage
- **TypeScript**: (~80%) Used for the majority of the library's code, providing a clean and maintainable architecture.
- **HTML**: (~12%) Used for structuring the content and layout of the popovers.
- **CSS**: (~6%) Used for styling the popovers and customizing their appearance.
- **JavaScript**: (~2%) Used for handling user interactions and updating the popover content.

## Repository Organization and Quality
The Littlefoot repository is well-organized, with the following key files and folders:

- **`README.md`**: Contains essential information about the library, including installation instructions, usage examples, and configuration options.
- **`package.json`**: Lists the dependencies used by the library, along with their versions.
- **`CHANGELOG.md`**: Provides a version history of the library, highlighting changes and updates.
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and folders that should be ignored by Git.
- **`/test`**: Contains test scripts for all methods used in the library.
- **`/src`**: Houses the source code for the library, including:
  - **`/dom`**: Defines the Document Object Model (DOM) for different items, such as events, footnotes, layout, and scroll, in TypeScript.
  - **`document.ts`**: Contains the main code for the library, including settings and user-interaction handling.
  - **`littlefoot.css`**: Styles the footnotes and popovers.
  - **`littlefoot.ts`**: Defines the main settings and configuration options for the library.
  - **`settings.ts`**: Specifies default settings for the library.
  - **`use-case.ts`**: Defines user interactions and responses.
- **`/cypress`**: Contains end-to-end integration test scripts written in Cypress.
- **`/.github/workflows`**: Defines the CI/CD pipeline for the library.

## Tool Quality
Littlefoot offers several features that enhance its tool quality:

- **Easy Integration**: Can be easily integrated with popular frameworks like WordPress and Gatsby, showcasing its flexibility.
- **Customization Options**: Provides multiple options, such as activation methods (click, hover), delay for activation, and dismissal.

## Conclusion
Littlefoot is a well-designed and lightweight JavaScript library that simplifies the process of creating clickable buttons with automatic popover configuration. Its use of TypeScript, responsive design, and customization options make it an attractive solution for developers.
